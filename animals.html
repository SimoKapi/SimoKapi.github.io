        <div class="animals"><p>Animals are an important part of out ecosystem. They keep the amount of other life on our planet in control, and some, like bees and birds, help plants reproduce. Other animals, such as cats and dogs, are used as house pets, with which you can be friends and play with. Or some dogs, for example, are used to guide blind people, or to find dear or living bodies, even when the bodies are buried in sand. Without animals, life would be sad for some time, but then all humanity would cease to exisst.</p>

    <h2 id="cougar">Cougars</h2><br>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>A mountain lion, also known as a cougar, or scientifically, Puma concolor is a predator dangerous to animals. Though they are not dangerous to mankind in Grand Canyon, they can be as dangerous to humans as any other animal anywhere else. As of the moment, they are not endangered, but they total number of cougars in the world is regressing. Soon, they might as well be endangered.</p>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Adult mountain lions are about 2-3 feet from the bottom of the feet to the shoulders, and their length is about 6-7.5 feet from the tip of their lengthy tail to the tip of their nose. Mountain lions have round heads with pricked up ears, pointed and erected. Their front legs and their necks are powerful, while their hind legs are long, engineered for jumps and running short distances at high speeds. They have tawny fur, with lighter spots around their nose and their throat.</p>
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Cougars live in a large variety of habitats, as far north as the Canadian Yukon to as south as the Southern Andes in South America. They also live in the Grand Canyon, mostly in the forests on the south and north edges.</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>A cougar feasts on mule deer and elk, though they do eat other animals. Their tactic is that they silently stalk the prey until the hunter feels that the prey cannot escape anymore. Then they jump out of their hiding spot and go right for the killing bite, this being the back of the neck. They can take down animals of many sizes with this. Cougars are nocturnal, meaning that they have very adept eyesight and only need about one sixth (⅙) of light to see than a human does. They are solitary animals, and they hunt alone. They do not feast on humans in the Grand Canyon, because they do not see humans as prey.</p>
        <h3>Interesting facts</h3>
        <p>A cougar is usually killed by cars, becoming roadkill, rather than hunters or other animals. So watch out if you’re driving – a mountain lion might just jump into your path! A female mountain lion raises 1-6 cubs in their life, and they can raise these cubs without any help from males. The newborn infants have blue eyes and rings on their tail.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>All in all, cougars are pretty interesting animals with a variety of abilities. I am not a hundred percent sure if it is legal to hunt them, but even if it is, please make sure to not hunt them, as they are magnificent animals and you are only taking their life in order to get some rewards. Remember, a mother cougar, same as a mother of any other predator, will always protect her young, even if she has to give up her life for it. So stay clear of mothers with cubs, as it may be your last sight of them.</p>

        <h2 id="kiwii">Kiwii</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The name “Kiwi” is a little bit weird name for an animal like this, but they were named kiwi for their unusual calls. These animals are in danger of extinction.</p>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>The Kiwi is the only bird in the world with nostrils at the end of the beak. It has tiny wings, shaggy brown hair-like feathers, long bill, pale face, three toed feet with sharp claws, and short pale brown legs. They also have short but powerful legs that help them run, burrow in the soil, and kick. They have no tail. The bird is about the size of a house cat, and range from 18 to 33 inches (45 to 84 cm) long and 1 foot (30 cm) tall. Kiwi females are larger. The weight of this bird is 2 ¾ to 9 pounds (1.25 to 4 kg)</p>
        <h3>Eggs and Chicks</h3>
        <p>Females lay eggs that are ⅕ of their own body weight. The egg is 5 inches(13 cm) long, and is white to pale green. This egg is then laid in burrow dug with the female’s feet. The female lays 1 to 2 eggs in each clutch. Females produce 2 to 3 clutches a year. The male then incubates the eggs.</p>
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>This bird lives in New Zealand in forests, scrub, swamps, grasslands and farmlands.</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>These interesting birds eat insects, worms and spiders. They eat seeds and fruit. They catch bugs with their long beak. The beak is poked into soil to disturb bugs underground, then catches and eats the exposed bug. Their nostrils at the end of the beak is used to sniff out prey.</p>
        <h3>Predators</h3>
        <p>Many animals hunt the adult Kiwis, including dogs and ferrets. About 95 percent of all of the Kiwi chicks are taken away by predators. Even cats and stoats take away chicks.</p>
        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
        <p>These birds have a lifespan up to 40 years. They are nocturnal, and belong to a group of ratites. There are 6 species of Kiwis (genus Apteryx).</p>

        <h2 id="kinkajou">Kinkajou</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Kinkajous are animals who mostly live in trees. I think they are nice animals, and good climbers, I have to say.</p>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Kinkajous have furry, long tails. They live in rainforests of Mexico, Central America, and South America. They are nocturnal, and in daylight, they sleep in a hollow tree. They spend most of their life in tree’s branches, and they cling to them with their prehensile tail. They communicate by grunts or growls, but also by scent, which is weird to me. They have scent glands near the mouth, – now get ready, because this is going to be really weird- they have scent glands on the throat and on the belly! What is this? They are related to raccoons. They have red-brown to tan fur, and a long, prehensile tail. Kinkajous range from 17-22 inches (43-56 cm) in length, and their tail is 16-22 inches long (41-56 cm). They also have claws on their paws, and a long but narrow tongue.</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Kinkajous are omnivores. They eat fruit, nectar from flowers, insects, small mammals (Poor mammals), birds, and honey, which they get with their long but narrow tongue by sticking it into the bee hive. They use their claws on their paws to pluck and eat fruit from trees of bushes.</p>
        <h3>Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Females lay usually one egg. Two eggs are less common. After birth, the kinkajou babies are blind, but they can grasp things with their tails.</p>
        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
        <p>Kinkajou’s predators are foxes, jaguarundis, jaguars, ocelots, margay, tayra, and sadly, even people.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I think kinkajous are nice animals to meet. They look nice and I like them. If you ever hear growls or grunts, maybe it’ll be a kinkajou? They hang in trees, and I like that. As people are their predators, it is safer in the branches of trees.</p>

        <h2 id="arctic-fox">Arctic Fox</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Hello! I am an arctic fox, and I will tell you about me in this text. I hope you enjoy. From my point of view, I think that arctic foxes are cute. Just look at my eyes and my nose! Well, anyways, let’s get into it so you know a lot more about me than you probably did up until now.</p>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>In winter, my fur is white, while in the summer it is grayish-brown! I guess you didn’t know this? There is also a blue morph of me, one of which is my friend. He is bluish in winter, but chocolate brown in summer. We all use our colors to camouflage. It works a lot. I am 20 inches long (50 centimeters) along with my tail, which is 12 inches long (30 centimeters). My long bushy tail is called a sweep. It helps me change direction of where I’m running quickly. Or even walking, really. It warms up my feet and nose while I sleep – I curl it up around myself.<br>I have sharp, curved claws, sharp teeth, and thick insulating fur. I also have small ears. They are small for a reason. It is to give off minimum heat. You wouldn’t want me to freeze to death now, would you?</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>I am a carnivore. I hunt alone, with no one to help me. I eat eggs, birds, insects, fish, and carrion. But my favourite, just my favourite, I don’t want you to think that everyone likes this, are small mammals. These are for example lemmings and voles. I sometimes use this one trick, I follow polar bears on their hunt. These big guys, polar bears, are pretty good hunters, so i just follow them, and then when they leave, I finish off the remains of its kills.</p>
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>I live in the far north, in the tundras. My fellow arctic foxes also live in coastal areas of North America, Iceland, Greenland, Scandinavia, and Siberia. I am the mammal that lives the farthest on the north, farther than any other land mammal. Because polar bears are partly aquatic, and not completely land mammals, I am the one.</p>
        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
        <p>Did you know, that I, because I am a male, am called a “reynard”? Females are called “vixen”, and If i’d have a baby, it would be called a “kit”. A group, for example me and my friends, are called a “skulk”, or a “leash”. I am hunted by polar bears and wolves. When I do my hunting trick with the polar bears – I need to be careful.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Goodbye, humans! I really do hope that you enjoyed my presentation about myself! Make sure that you remember it all, and that you actually enjoyed it! Wait, a polar bear’s coming. Got to go hide. Don’t worry, I’ll survive. I hope…. Bye now!</p>

        <h2 id="dholes">Dholes</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Dholes have a weird name. I don’t know why they are named Dhole. I think they are nice animals, similar to dogs, but different in their own way.</p>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Dholes are medium-sized animals. They have a red-brown coat and a tail with a black tip. They communicate with whistles, clucks, and high-pitched screams. Adults are 3 feet (90 cm) long with a tail 17 inches long (43 cm).</p>
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Dholes live in temperate forests, rainforests, and rarely steppes of India, China, Tibet, Malaysia, and a lot of southern Asia. They are endangered because of a rapid loss of their habitat.</p>
        <h3>Diet, Hunting</h3>
        <p>Dholes live in small packs of five to twelve (sometimes even more) adults. They hunt deer, wild goats, and mountain sheep. These animals are carnivores. Dholes are good swimmers. They find prey with their keen sense of smell, and they chase their prey into water. They swallow meat in large chunks.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I think dholes are nice animals. They look like foxes, but they are a type of dog. I like the fact that they are good swimmers. They also have the red-brown coat, and i like that on them. Do you like dholes too?</p>

I have powerful jaws, with sharp teeth. My teeth can even snap open bones! To eat the marrow that’s inside. I have a strong digestive system, meaning I can swallow bones, teeth, tough skin, and even horns!</p>
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>I live in Africa, in the Sahara Desert, the south, middle east, and asia. There I live in savannas, and dry plains.</p>
        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
        <p>Did you know, that I can live without water for several days? That’s one of the perks of living in dry places, you know. When I’m excited, usually when i see food, I make a giggling sound. Humans like you sometimes call me the laughing hyena. There are many types of hyenas, the spotted hyena, which is me, the brown hyena, the striped hyena, and the aardwolf. I am mostly related to mongooses and cats. I’m a strong runner. I am territorial and social. Every hyena lives in a group, called clans. I have a 12 year lifespan, but I can live up to 25 years.</p>
